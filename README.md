# personal-site-demos

This project will be a grab-bag of digestible demos of tools within AWS or of general development concepts. Every directory under `demos/` that contains its own Readme should define a Terraform module provisiong AWS API Gateway resource, endpoint, method, and integration resources. Some subset of these will be referenced and exposed by the Gateway managed by the [personal-site-gw](https://github.com/jamesdylanconklin/personal-site-gw) repository
